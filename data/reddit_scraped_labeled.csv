"This megathread compiles information and news regarding the escalating hate and violence towards people of Asian descent. Related posts will not be limited to this megathread only.

## Context

Racism, harassment, and violence against Asian people is not new. It has been the experience of many for centuries wherever they exist in marginalized/minority communities. But over the last year, Asian American and Pacific Islander peoples have especially been met with a massive escalation in this racism/violence towards them. This is due to hateful, ignorant, bigots tying COVID-19's origin in China to any person who even vaguely appears to be Asian. Racist rhetoric against Asian people was pushed and amplified by major American politicians, most notably by the former President.

A recent study from the California State University, San Bernardino, found that while overall rates of hate crimes in the country decreased by 7% in 2020, anti-Asian hate crimes surged by 149%.

On March 16th, eight people were shot and killed at Atlanta-area massage parlors, six of whom were Asian women. This prompted an immediate outcry and protests to demand recognition and justice for a marginalized population who often go ignored or dismissed when it comes to racism and hate crimes.

&nbsp;

Topps Company, known for its Garbage Pail Kids trading cards, has a yearly issue of cards depicting the current year's Grammy winners in a satirical way, named ""The Shammy Awards"". The card dedicated to BTS was uniquely violent, titled ""BTS Bruisers"". It showed BTS members with beaten and bruised faces with a 'whack-a-mole' concept. Due to widespread criticism that the card was highly disrespectful, violent and particularly tone-deaf due to the current situation, Topps canceled production of the card and 'apologized'.

"**Hello and welcome to the latest Nugu Roundup!**

**What is this?:** This is a bi-weekly feature designed to highlight the unknown/underappreciated groups and soloists working hard in the Kpop world that often fall under the radar. Please share your own information, favorite performance videos, fanmeet stories, or anything else relevant below!

[In the last roundup we got to learn about the new boy group Ghost9](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/m526fc/nugu_roundup_71_uh_huh_listen_boy_my_first_ghost/). This edition, we're going to break the rules a bit and look at a group that's recently become very non-Nugu, but who was slaving away in obscurity up until very recently.  Since they've suddenly exploded in popularity, let's take a look at the journey up until now of the Brave Girls, and celebrate their graduation into the big time!

**Look at the first comment below for the winner of the 25th album giveaway plus details on this roundup's album up for grabs!**

**What is Nugu?:** While in Korean it literally means 'Who' in the broader Kpop context it refers to groups that are generally unknown amongst the greater public. It doesn't have to mean they're extremely new, though it can, and there are of course varying degrees of 'unknown' which some groups having very strong niche fandoms and others being almost invisible. I take a fairly broad view and will include groups that may be known to some, but who don't have widespread name recognition.

**Let's get on with the show...**

**Who?:**  The Brave Girls are a four member girl group under Brave Entertainment.  While the group originally debuted in 2011, the original lineup parted ways with the group over the years and the current lineup all joined the group in 2016.  The group takes their name from their company and producer Brave Brothers, and their fandom name is FEARLESS.  

**Company:** Brave Entertainment  was founded in 2008 by producer Brave Brothers, who is actually just one person, Kang Dong Cheol.  Brave Brothers has previously worked as a producer for YG Entertainment, as a solo rap artist, and has produced hits for notable groups such as T-ARA, Sistar, Brown Eyed Girls, Rania, After School, and AOA.  Brave Entertainment has also represented groups BIGSTAR and 1Punch and currently also represent boy group DKB.  

**Members**

* **Minyoung**
   * Position: Main Vocalist, Main Dancer
   * Real Name: Kim Min Young
   * Age: 30 (IA)
   * Facts:  She began trainee life rather late at 21 and originally was set to debut in group ZZ Best which never made it to debut.  While the group does not have an official leader she fills the role unofficially as the eldest member.  She later almost joined a dance team called Rosemass and considered going into acting before joining Brave Girls.  She had studied ballet and traditional Korean dance.  She is known to have very stable live vocals, and insists on singing live as much as possible.  In the group's song Rollin' there was a high note originally designed to only be sung by backing vocals due to the choreography requiring intense body rolls at that moment, but she insisted on doing the vocals live at that point.  Her legs are on the cover of the group's High Heels album, and she says the decision was a surprise - she was called out of practice suddenly and had oil applied to her legs and the photo was taken.  She says she has a low alcohol tolerance and can only drink about one beer.  She enjoys playing Futsal, a small-field indoor version of Soccer, and was quite active playing FIFA online in the past but says she doesn't have time to play much anymore.  She tends to confuse 360 degrees with 180 degrees in interviews.  She says her secret wish is for the group to win an award at an awards ceremony since the current lineup has never been nominated before.  She loves spicy food and salt water fish sushi.  She promised she would shave her head of Rollin' ever hit #1, but has thus far not come through.
* **Yujeong**
   * Position: Vocalist
   * Real Name: Nam Yu Jeong
   * Age: 29 (IA)
   * Facts: She previously competed on The Unit.  Before debut she was a backup dancer for boy group A.Cian along with WJSN's Yeorum.  She is known for having a very pretty smile and has been compared to the Pokemon Squirtle.  She is known as one of the variety stars in the group due to her natural and infectious laughter and reactions.  She can also speak English from time spent in school in Hong Kong, and helped tutor fellow-member Eunji in English for her exams.   She was an MC for a KBS Entertainment TV Show and has modeled for Maxim Korea.  She was a tomboy as a child and her mother had a Taemong Dream (a dream thought to foretell the gender of a child before birth in Korean superstition) of peppers, which is said to foretell the birth of a male child.  She is close with Hyeyeon of BESTie from her time in The Unit and the two still write and stay in touch.  She stays in shape by practicing Jiu Jitsu, in which she's attained the rank of Blue Belt.  She was a big fan of singer Rain from a young age, but her parents did not want her to become a singer, so she secretly withdrew from school to audition and follow her dreams.  She says her secret to performing well on stage is to pick one person out of the audience and only focus on them, thinking ""I'm going to show you everything, be prepared"" and derives her happiest moments on stage from that persons reactions.  She still carries a torch for a high school boyfriend who dumped her.  Her worry now that the group has become popular is that she'll make a mistake that will harm the group now that people are paying attention.  She dislikes western fast food such as hamburgers and ice-cream, but says the tteokbokki stand in front of the Brave Entertainment building her favorite. 
* **Eunji**
   * Position: Main Rapper, Vocalist
   * Real Name: Hong Eun Ji
   * Age: 28 (IA)
   * Facts: She took part in The Unit.  She has been the effective center of the group since the 2016 reboot.  She is said to resemble the Pokemon Goldeen.  While she is listed as the Main Rapper she's transitioned into more of a vocal role with Yuna taking more or the rap parts.  She is known for being very flexible and has trained in Akido since she was in kindergarten because her parents thought it was important for a woman to learn self-defense.  She has also recently began training for MMA fighting, but she is also known for being rather clumsy.  She took the place of Sandara Park in Park Bom's Spring performance on Queendom, and stood in for Park Bom in the Queendom Six Puzzle dance performance.  She says she originally hated the Rollin choreography even though the other members said she was best at it.  She prefers the original version of Rollin' because of the instrumental during the dance break near the end.  She became close to Minjae of Sonamoo when they took college courses together.  She has the best knowledge of the Brave Brothers back catalog in the current group.  She is very polite, but she can become shy in public situations and can often only manage an awkward thumbs up.  She says that during the long hiatus between Rollin' and We Ride she looked back on her life with disappointment thinking ""What have I done with my life?""  She likes to relieve stress by window shopping.  She enjoys western food and spicy food the best.  
* **Yuna**
   * Position: Lead Vocalist, Lead Rapper, Lead Dancer, Maknae
   * Real Name: Lee Yu Na
   * Age: 27 (IA)
   * Facts: She was born in Jeju but grew up in Bucheon, a satellite city of Seoul.  She auditioned for The Unit but did not make it into the show.  Korean netizens have dubbed her a 'Chado Girl' which is a term in the Korean internet to describe a city dweller who exudes a calm luxurious and sophisticated persona.  She is considered to be the most 'girl crush' member of the group.  She is known for having a chic appearance, however she obtained the nickname 'Snape' due to a resemblance of hairstyles, but she does not like it, though she says she always prefers to stick with short hair.  She originally wanted to become a solo singer but became discouraged and enrolled in flight attendant school.  She says she did not have an aptitude for it and decided to follow her dreams of singing instead and barely passed the auditions for Brave Entertainment.  She is known for being very frank in her interactions with fans online.  She was in a school band called Red Rock.  She is said to resemble Red Velvet's Irene and the Pokemon Bulbasaur.  She likes to relieve stress by cooking and cleaning.  Her favorite foods are Korean food, mint-chocolate ice cream, and watermelon.  Her favorite food is chicken and she's like to film a chicken CF.  She once took [a nasty fall on stage](https://youtu.be/edLHziEngOI?t=129) during the iconic chair choreo in Rollin, but only sustained bruises (and got right back into the choreography).   She says that after they finished promotions for ""We Ride"" she thought it was probably going to be the group's last song.  She wishes she'd been able to experience high school like a normal student instead of having to rush between trainee life and school life.  Her words of encouragment are ""Thank you so much for being in the world"".  She is good friends with Hana of Gugudan who lives in the same neighborhood as she does.

* **Song:** With an intro that rivals AOA's ***Like a Cat*** for best girl-group English intro of all time, this is the lead single from the group's third EP ""High Heels"" and my personal favorite Brave Girls song.  Bright, brassy, sassy, sexy, goofy, and fun this song is about women claiming ownership of their sexuality and approaching men confidently and without reservations.  As impressive as the song is the fact that live stages were performed in actual high heels (including the backup dancers).

* **Song:** The lead single from the group's fourth EP ""Rollin'"" this song in the Tropical House genre features a refreshing an springlike melody and instrumental combined with a dark and sexy vampire-themed MV.

**Trivia:** The group came very close to disbanding just as Rollin' began to blow up.  Members Yujeong and Yuna has already moved out of the dorms and the members were talking about what jobs they'd want to do in their post-idol careers when the song started to climb the charts.  Initially they said that they didn't expect anything to come from it as they'd been disappointed so many times before.  As the song started to climb the charts the members say they started only getting a few hours sleep each night as they kept obsessively checking the charts to see how high the song as climbing and they still can't believe the blow-up of their success.  

Minyoung has said she still can't believe people actually want to interview them now after so many years of no one caring about them, and is touched beyond words about the sudden interest.  She also worries since they've lived in the shadows for so long that the group is not very good at typical idol interactions and wants fans to be patient as they learn idol culture.

The group is a fan of the new cover art for Rollin', which is based on a design by a fan.  They feel it expresses the refreshing nature of the song better than the original cover art.  The group has the greatest respect for their military fans who have always been strong for them, and say that they love military performances the best since they always get much more energy from the crowd during them which enhances the quality of their performance.  

The group says that their initial impression of their CEO Brave Brothers was that he was very scary, like a tiger that had gone ten years without meat, but that over time he has mellowed out and they now have a good relationship.  While the age of the group is older than most for third-generation groups, they say that Brave Entertainment specifically searched for older members to better match the age of the remaining members from the original lineup. 

The group holds records for both the longest time between debut and their first music show win, and having the longest Perfect All-Kill Streak for a girl group.

*  **Song:** The group's first (and only) digital single, this rock-infused hip-hop song is the highlight for the group's discography IMO, with a great chorus, and a return to a more playful style both musically and visually this reminds of of Block B during their peak or some of the more playful songs from N.Flying without being a copy of either.  Sadly, the song that seems to have finally found the group staking out a sound unique to them would be their last.
* **Composers/Producers:** *BC* (group member), *Sebastian Berglund* (Monsta X - [Give Me Dat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cc1_JK-W3m4), SF9 - [I'll Hold Your Hand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8M0Q3Z42Iqg))

**YouTube Channel:** [1Team Official](https://www.youtube.com/c/1TEAMofficial/videos)

**Active Between:** March 2019 - March 2021

**Reasons for Disbanding:** While the company did not release an official reason for disbanding the group, it's likely due to financial concerns due to low album sales (average between 4K-5K for each of their three EPs) and the effects of COVID on the industry, and the group had a nearly year-long period between releases during the height of the pandemic.

**Trivia:** The group was supposed to do a US Tour in early 2020, and was able to perform several shows in March of 2020, however as the seriousness of the global pandemic began to sink in the final shows were canceled and the group returned to Korea.  Member BC took part in the BOYS24 competition show as well as MixNine.  He was also a former member of boy group I-REX.  Member Rubin took part in BOYS24 and MixNine as well, and made it into the top 9 for MixNine and would've debuted in the group had YG not pulled the plug on the entire operation.

"First of all, no, I'm not talking about some Steve Aoki remixes or stuff like the Stray Kids × Alesso thing. So for example with A.C.E, they started off with CACTUS and Callin' which were two beautiful examples of how Hardstyle can be combined with K-Pop, or Stray Kids, who have repeatedly have used EDM heavily in their tracks (especially in the CLÉ albums) such as MIROH or Hellevator, and with them its become a recurring thing, also with a lot of Trap featured in their releases.

For me personally as a dedicated EDM listener, I only really listen to that kind of K-Pop and have a hard time finding more, since I don't really know where to start. Also the EDM communities are often times rather hostile against K-Pop, which is why I think implementing more elements/genres (I'd for example ABSOLUTELY LOVE a Progressive House-K-Pop track) and I think it would be a great way of uniting both communities.


EDIT: since I think there is a bit of confusion on what I mean, here are some examples:

"We've witnessed several major stuff during the first quarter of Kpop 2021. Overall, I would describe it as **""Up and Down""**. This relates to the sudden surge of Brave Girls' popularity with the help of their song ""Rollin"" and cheers from the ROK; very similar to the sudden stardom of EXID in late 2014 with their song ""Up and Down"". While we witnessed the ""Up"" of Kpop with Brave Girls', the ""Down"" portion relates to the bullying controversy, particularly with April. The group was on such good trajectory with their personal best with LALALILALA, but now they are suffering heavy losses with these recent events.

"*""Share what you love.”*

I translate kpop related clips to help out the Kpop community.

If you have a song, clip, video you want to see translated, leave a comment.

Rules

1. One request per person. Leaving a link would expedite the process.
2. For time sake, I do summary translation rather than word by word. The idea is to get the meaning across rather than get linguistic perfection.
3. If you think request is too long, it probably is. Be reasonable in length.
4. No reply means…translation exists somewhere, you didn’t look hard enough or you broke one of the rules.

I post on Friday and translate on Sunday. \[by 5pm PST\]

But if the dating news is true, then we will congratulate him."" and then Yang Hyun Suk himself going ""We're happy cause Taeyang has said until now that he’s been single his whole life.
